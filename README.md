## Infomration

This project was (mostly) created in a period of 5 days just for fun! It turns out Google's Places API is pretty expensive and I will probably remove it from the AppStore at some point.

You can check out more details at https://bradenbagby.com/Portfolio/Items/tenders.html

To run this project, you will need an environment folder located at config/environment.json
